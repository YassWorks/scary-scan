Super Scary Scan is a tool designed to perform comprehensive scans using:

- **NMAP** for network exploration and security auditing.
- **Shodan** for discovering devices and services exposed on the internet.

This project serves as a learning experience to explore technologies like **FastAPI**, **React**, and **MongoDB**. It is a demo and part of a larger project currently under development.
